                <p>Teams abounded throughout the 1920s. There were hundreds of men's professional basketball
                    teams
                    in
                    towns and cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional
                    game.
                    Players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls. Leagues
                    came
                    and went. Barnstorming squads such as the Original Celtics and two all-African American
                    teams,
                    the
                    New York Renaissance Five ("Rens") and the (still existing) Harlem Globetrotters played up
                    to
                    two
                    hundred games a year on their national tours.</p>
                <p>In 1946, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_Association_of_America" target="_blank">
                        <strong style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">the Basketball Association of
                            America (BAA)</strong> </a>was formed. The first game was played in
                    Toronto, Ontario, Canada between the Toronto Huskies and New York Knickerbockers on November
                    1,
                    1946. Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL)
                    to
                    form

                            (NBA)</strong> </a>. By the 1950s, basketball had become a major
                    college
                    sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball. In 1959, a
                    basketball hall of fame was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts, site of the first game.
                    Its
                    rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have
                    contributed
                    significantly to the development of the game. The hall of fame has people who have
                    accomplished
                    many
                    goals in their career in basketball. An upstart organization, the American Basketball
                    Association,
                    emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976.
                    Today
                    the NBA is the top professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity,
                    salaries,
                    talent, and level of competition.
                </p>
                <p>The NBA has featured many famous players, including George Mikan, the first dominating "big
                    man";
                    ball-handling wizard Bob Cousy and defensive genius Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics;
                    charismatic
                    center Wilt Chamberlain, who originally played for the barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters;
                    all-around
                    stars Oscar Robertson and Jerry West; more recent big men Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille
                    O'Neal,
                    Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone; playmakers John Stockton, Isiah Thomas and Steve Nash;
                    crowd-pleasing forwards Julius Erving and Charles Barkley; European stars Dirk Nowitzki, Pau

                    Curry;
                    and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest
                    level
                    of
                    popularity during the 1980s and 1990s: Larry Bird, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, and Michael
                    Jordan.
                </p>
                <p>In 2001, the NBA formed a developmental league, the National Basketball Development League
                    (later
                    known as the NBA D-League and then the NBA G League after a branding deal with Gatorade). As

                            Federation):</strong> </a>was formed in 1932 by
                    eight
                    founding nations: Argentina,
                    Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland. At this time, the
                    organization only oversaw amateur players. Its acronym, derived from the French Fédération
                    Internationale de Basket-ball Amateur, was thus "FIBA". Men's basketball was first included
                    at
                    the
                    Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics, although a demonstration tournament was held in 1904. The
                    United
                    States
                    defeated Canada in the first final, played outdoors. This competition has usually been
                    dominated
                    by
                    the United States, whose team has won all but three titles. The first of these came in a
                    controversial final game in Munich in 1972 against the Soviet Union, in which the ending of
                    the
                    game
                    was replayed three times until the Soviet Union finally came out on top. In 1950 the first
                    FIBA
                    World Championship for men, now known as the FIBA Basketball World Cup, was held in
                    Argentina.
                    Three
                    years later, the first FIBA World Championship for women, now known as the FIBA Women's
                    Basketball
                    World Cup, was held in Chile. Women's basketball was added to the Olympics in 1976, which
                    were
                    held
                    in Montreal, Quebec, Canada with teams such as the Soviet Union, Brazil and Australia
                    rivaling
                    the
                    American squads.</p>
                <p>In 1989, FIBA allowed professional NBA players to participate in the Olympics for the first
                    time.
                    Prior to the 1992 Summer Olympics, only European and South American teams were allowed to
                    field
                    professionals in the Olympics. The United States' dominance continued with the introduction
                    of
                    the
                    original Dream Team. In the 2004 Athens Olympics, the United States suffered its first
                    Olympic
                    loss
                    while using professional players, falling to Puerto Rico (in a 19-point loss) and Lithuania
                    in
                    group
                    games, and being eliminated in the semifinals by Argentina. It eventually won the bronze
                    medal
                    defeating Lithuania, finishing behind Argentina and Italy. The Redeem Team, won gold at the
                    2008
                    Olympics, and the B-Team, won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey despite
                    featuring
                    no players from the 2008 squad. The United States continued its dominance as they won gold
                    at
                    the
                    2012 Olympics, 2014 FIBA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.</p>

                    popularity of the sport is reflected in the nationalities represented in the NBA. Players

                    all
                    six inhabited continents currently play in the NBA. Top international players began coming

                    the

                <p> In the Philippines, the Philippine Basketball Association's first game was played on April
                    9,
                    1975,
                    at the Araneta Coliseum in Cubao, Quezon City, Philippines. It was founded as a "rebellion"
                    of
                    several teams from the now-defunct Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association,
                    which
                    was
                    tightly controlled by the Basketball Association of the Philippines (now defunct), the
                    then-FIBA
                    recognized national association. Nine teams from the MICAA participated in the league's
                    first
                    season
                    that opened on April 9, 1975. The NBL is Australia's pre-eminent men's professional
                    basketball
                    league. The league commenced in 1979, playing a winter season (April–September) and did so
                    until
                    the
                    completion of the 20th season in 1998. The 1998–99 season, which commenced only months
                    later,
                    was
                    the first season after the shift to the current summer season format (October–April). This
                    shift
                    was
                    an attempt to avoid competing directly against Australia's various football codes. It
                    features 8
                    teams from around Australia and one in New Zealand. A few players including Luc Longley,
                    Andrew
                    Gaze, Shane Heal, Chris Anstey and Andrew Bogut made it big internationally, becoming poster
                    figures
                    for the sport in Australia. The Women's National Basketball League began in 1981.</p>

                <p><b id="Bold-black"> Women's basketball</b> began in 1892 at Smith College when Senda
                    Berenson, a
                    physical education teacher,
                    modified Naismith's rules for women. Shortly after she was hired at Smith, she went to
                    Naismith
                    to
                    learn more about the game. Fascinated by the new sport and the values it could teach, she
                    organized the first women's collegiate basketball game on March 21, 1893, when her Smith
                    freshmen
                    and sophomores played against one another. However, the first women's interinstitutional
                    game
                    was played in 1892 between the University of California and Miss Head's School. Berenson's
                    rules
                    were first published in 1899, and two years later she became the editor of A. G. Spalding's
                    first
                    Women's Basketball Guide. Berenson's freshmen played the sophomore class in the first
                    women's
                    intercollegiate basketball game at Smith College, March 21, 1893. The same year, Mount
                    Holyoke
                    and Sophie Newcomb College (coached by Clara Gregory Baer) women began playing basketball.
                    By
                    1895,
                    the game had spread to colleges across the country, including Wellesley, Vassar, and Bryn
                    Mawr.
                    The
                    first intercollegiate women's game was on April 4, 1896. Stanford women played Berkeley,
                    9-on-9,
                    ending in a 2–1 Stanford victory.</p>
                <p>Women's basketball development was more structured than that for men in the early years. In
                    1905,
                    the executive committee on Basket Ball Rules (National Women's Basketball Committee) was
                    created
                    by
                    the American Physical Education Association. These rules called for six to nine players per
                    team
                    and 11 officials. The International Women's Sports Federation (1924) included a women's
                    basketball
                    competition. 37 women's high school varsity basketball or state tournaments were held by
                    1925.
                    And
                    in 1926, the Amateur Athletic Union backed the first national women's basketball
                    championship,
                    complete with men's rules. The Edmonton Grads, a touring Canadian women's team based in
                    Edmonton, Alberta, operated between 1915 and 1940. The Grads toured all over North America,
                    and
                    were
                    exceptionally successful. They posted a record of 522 wins and only 20 losses over that
                    span, as
                    they met any team that wanted to challenge them, funding their tours from gate receipts. The
                    Grads also shone on several exhibition trips to Europe, and won four consecutive exhibition
                    Olympics
                    tournaments, in 1924, 1928, 1932, and 1936; however, women's basketball was not an official
                    Olympic
                    sport until 1976. The Grads' players were unpaid, and had to remain single. The Grads' style
                    focused
                    on team play, without overly emphasizing skills of individual players. The first women's AAU
                    All-America team was chosen in 1929. Women's industrial leagues sprang up throughout the
                    United
                    States, producing famous athletes, including Babe Didrikson of the Golden Cyclones, and the
                    All
                    American Red Heads Team, which competed against men's teams, using men's rules. By 1938, the
                    women's
                    national championship changed from a three-court game to two-court game with six players per
                    team.</p>

                    1997.
                    Though it had shaky
                    attendance figures, several marquee players (Lisa Leslie, Diana Taurasi, and Candace Parker
                    among
                    others) have helped the league's popularity and level of competition. Other professional
                    women's
                    basketball leagues in the United States, such as the American Basketball League (1996–98),
                    have
                    folded in part because of the popularity of the WNBA. The WNBA has been looked at by many as
                    a
                    niche
                    league. However, the league has recently taken steps forward. In June 2007, the WNBA signed
                    a
                    contract extension with ESPN. The new television deal ran from 2009 to 2016. Along with this
                    deal,
                    came the first-ever rights fees to be paid to a women's professional sports league. Over the
                    eight
                    years of the contract, "millions and millions of dollars" were "dispersed to the league's
                    teams." In
                    a March 12, 2009 article, NBA commissioner David Stern said that in the bad economy, "the
                    NBA is
                    far
                    less profitable than the WNBA. We're losing a lot of money among a large number of teams.
                    We're
                    budgeting the WNBA to break even this year."</p>

                <p>
                    In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical education and instructor at the
                    International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in
                    Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought
                    a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long
                    New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in
                    gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score
                    points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall. Naismith wrote the basic rules and
                    nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track. Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its
                    bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point
                    scored. This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls
                    to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket.</p>

                <p><strong style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Old style basketball with laces
                        Basketball</strong> was originally played with a soccer ball. These round balls from
                    "association football"
                    were made, at the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the
                    inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped
                    outside-in. These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable.
                    Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this change to the game was
                    endorsed by Naismith. (Whereas in American football, the lace construction proved to be advantageous
                    for gripping and remains to this day.) The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown,
                    and it was only in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible
                    to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was
                    not part of the original game except for the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the
                    primary means of ball movement. Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric
                    shape of early balls.[dubious – discuss] Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the
                    double dribble by 1898.</p>
                <p>The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with
                    backboards. A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through. Whenever a person got
                    the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point. Whichever team got the most points won the
                    game. The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this
                    proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots. The backboard was
                    introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots.
                    Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that he was
                    nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game called
                    duck on a rock, as many had failed before it.</p>
                <p>Frank Mahan, one of the players from the original first game, approached Naismith after the
                    Christmas break, in early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his new game. Naismith replied
                    that he hadn't thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the game started. Mahan
                    suggested that it be called "Naismith ball", at which he laughed, saying that a name like that would
                    kill any game. Mahan then said, "Why not call it basketball?" Naismith replied, "We have a basket
                    and a ball, and it seems to me that would be a good name for it."The first official game
                    was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine players. The
                    game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the size of a
                    present-day Streetball or National Basketball Association (NBA) court.</p>
                <p>At the time, soccer was being played with 10 to a team (which was increased to 11). When winter
                    weather got too icy to play soccer, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have them
                    split in half and play basketball with five on each side. By 1897–1898 teams of five became
                    standard.</p>

                <p>Measurements and time limits discussed in this section
                    often vary among tournaments and organizations; international and NBA rules are used in this
                    section.</p>
                <p>The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents'
                    basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own. An attempt to score
                    in
                    this way is called a shot. A successful shot is worth two points, or three points if it is taken
                    from beyond the three-point arc 6.75 metres (22 ft 2 in) from the basket in international games
                    and 23 feet 9 inches (7.24 m) in NBA games. A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from
                    the foul line after a foul is made. After a team has scored from a field goal or free throw,
                    play is
                    resumed with a throw-in awarded to the non-scoring team taken from a point beyond the endline of
                    the
                    court where the points(s) were scored.</p>
                <p>Playing regulations
                    Games are played in four quarters of 10 (FIBA) or 12 minutes (NBA). College men's games use two
                    20-minute halves, college women's games use 10-minute quarters, and most United States high
                    school varsity games use 8-minute quarters; however, this varies from state to state. 15 minutes
                    are allowed for a half-time break under FIBA, NBA, and NCAA rules and 10 minutes in United
                    States high schools. Overtime periods are five minutes in length except for high school,
                    which is four minutes in length. Teams exchange baskets for the second half. The time allowed is
                    actual playing time; the clock is stopped while the play is not active. Therefore, games
                    generally
                    take
                    much longer to complete than the allotted game time, typically about two hours.</p>
                <p>Five players from each team may be on the court at one time. Substitutions are unlimited
                    but can only be done when play is stopped. Teams also have a coach, who oversees the development
                    and
                    strategies of the team, and other team personnel such as assistant coaches, managers,
                    statisticians,
                    doctors and trainers.</p>
                <p> For both men's and women's teams, a standard uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey
                    with
                    a
                    clearly visible number, unique within the team, printed on both the front and back. Players wear
                    high-top sneakers that provide extra ankle support. Typically, team names, players' names and,
                    outside
                    of North America, sponsors are printed on the uniforms.</p>
                <p> A limited number of time-outs, clock stoppages requested by a coach (or sometimes mandated in
                    the
                    NBA)
                    for a short meeting with the players, are allowed. They generally last no longer than one minute
                    (100
                    seconds in the NBA) unless, for televised games, a commercial break is needed.</p>
                <p> The game is controlled by the officials consisting of the referee (referred to as crew chief in
                    the
                    NBA), one or two umpires (referred to as referees in the NBA) and the table officials. For
                    college,
                    the
                    NBA, and many high schools, there are a total of three referees on the court. The table
                    officials
                    are
                    responsible for keeping track of each team's scoring, timekeeping, individual and team fouls,
                    player
                    substitutions, team possession arrow, and the shot clock.</p>
